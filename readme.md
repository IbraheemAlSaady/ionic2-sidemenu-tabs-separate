## navigation

Using the app component just to set the root page. 
The root page will be the starter page and it will have all the components, like the sidemenu.

On Navigation, in the Root page component, I added another property to the pages array, this will indicate whether the page should be opened under the navigation root, or it will be pushed by the navigationController to be opened in a separate page.
